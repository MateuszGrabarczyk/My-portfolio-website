          I graduated from Silesian University of Technology in Gliwice. I
          studied Computer Science with a specialization in Web Development.
          During university I started my career as Web Developer and I'm still
          working in this field as it's my passion. My favourite frameworks are
          Django and React. If you want to learn more about my experience, check
